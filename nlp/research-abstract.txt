Current actual achievement.
 [1] Original object-oriented language,
 which is syntactically customizable (current implementation is Java-like.).
 This means a kind of notation of object is immediately converted to executable program.
 [2] Natural language processor,
 whose current implementation interprets text script and generates language structure
 such like Lisp (tuple-wide evaluation enabled).
 This means specification in proper grammar can be converted to definitions of classes,
 instances and methods and execution statements.
 [3] Reachability specification notation and reachability analyzer with SAT solver.
 This means general purpose reachability specification notation has already developed.
 This notation doesnâ€™t depend on specific verification language such as SPIN.
 [4] As my opened achievements, see achievement list.
