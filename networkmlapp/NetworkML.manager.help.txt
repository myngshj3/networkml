Hello, my signature is '{}'.
For seeing my available methods, request as follow,
    available_methods()
Once you identify callable method, you may see the usage, requesting as follow,
    my_method(--help)
Also, I may understand original meanings of script. If you need, try as follow,
    interpret(text-script)

Good luck!
